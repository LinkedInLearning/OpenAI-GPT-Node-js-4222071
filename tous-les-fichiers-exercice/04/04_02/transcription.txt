Generative AI is a cutting-edge technology that has evolved significantly in the field of machine learning. Until the release of CHAT-GPT, machine learning had been steadily progressing. Generative AI specifically refers to systems that can generate human-like text, images, or other content autonomously. In the early stages of machine learning, algorithms were mainly rule-based and required manual programming. However, with advancements in neural networks and deep learning, machine learning evolved into a data-driven approach. Neural networks, inspired by the human brain structure, became crucial. They enabled computers to learn patterns from vast datasets, making applications like image and speech recognition possible. Generative AI emerged as a natural progression, allowing machines to not only recognize but also create content
